# Project 6: Hack Assembler

## Overview

This project implements an assembler for the Hack computer from "The Elements of Computing Systems" (Nand2Tetris). The assembler translates Hack assembly language into 16-bit binary code, handling both symbol-less and symbol-rich programs using a two-pass process.

## Project Structure

- **assembler.py:** Main Python script that implements the assembler.
- **Parser Module:** Reads and parses the input `.asm` file, removing comments and whitespace.
- **Code Module:** Contains lookup tables and functions for converting assembly mnemonics (`comp`, `dest`, `jump`) into binary codes.
- **SymbolTable Module:** Manages symbols (labels and variables) and maps them to their corresponding addresses.
- **test_code.py:** Unit tests for verifying that the Code module functions correctly.

## How to Run

1. **Assembly Process:**  
   To assemble a Hack assembly file, run:
   ```bash
   python assembler.py <inputfile.asm> <outputfile.hack>
   ```
   For example:
   ```bash
   python assembler.py Add.asm Add.hack
   ```

2. **Unit Testing:**  
   Run the unit tests using:
   ```bash
   python -m unittest test_code.py
   ```

## Testing and Verification

- **Comparison Testing:**  
  I verified that the output `.hack` files match exactly with the reference output generated by the supplied Nand2Tetris assembler using the compare feature.

- **CPU Emulator Testing:**  
  I loaded the generated `.hack` files into the Hack CPU Emulator to confirm that the programs execute correctly on the simulated hardware.
